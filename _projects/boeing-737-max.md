# Boeing 737 Max Ethical Analysis

#### Background
The 737Max aircraft was introduced to the public by Boeing in August 2011. Although widely successfully and operated worldwide the original 737 airframe was start to be dated and held back due to the it age; it has been running since the 1960s. In December of 2010, Airbus announced the A320neo, a modern update to one its most popular airframes as well. This announcement was met with praise and business grew for Airbus. As Boeing’s biggest competitor, this success drove Boeing to abandon plans for a completely new line of aircraft and instead pursue at refresh of the 737 family [1]. This resulted in the introduction of the 737Max just a few month after the A320neo was introduced with similar engines and other improvements, which quickly became one of Boeing fastest-selling airliner [1]. 

The success was short lived, as just one year after entering service, a 737Max operated by Lion Air crashed just 13 minutes after takeoff, with everyone onboard dying.  The investigation revealed a control system MCAS was activated 26 times in ten minutes and forced the nose of the plane downwards. The investigation placed blame on Boeing and FAA for this incident. Following this tragedy, some safety directives were created and information publicized to allow pilots to understand what this system does and how to fix it when it is not working properly. However, despite these changes, another 737Max operated by Ethiopia Airlines crashed just 6 minutes after takeoff, leaving no survivors. With yet another tragic crash, all 737Max aircrafts worldwide were grounded and the design was heavily blamed. 

#### Engineering Decisions
As mentioned earlier, Boeing was severely pressured by the commercial success of their biggest competitor, Airbus. Moreover, the A320neo directly competes with the 737’s market segment. Under such pressure, Boeing decided to place more modern LEAP-1B engines on the preexisting 737 frame. This introduced several engineering challenges. The new engines were bigger than the old engines, and the 737 frame did not have sufficient ground clearance. To address this issue Boeing place the new engines were mounted higher and more forward than the previous engines. This new position introduces a vortex at high angles of attack, and due to the center of gravity being behind this vortex location, the plane would pitch higher, making the angle of attack even higher[2]. To suppress this behavior, Boeing decided to implement their Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). This system, using an angle of attack sensor, would automatically force the pitch of the plane downwards. 

#### Ehtical Implications
Although the MCAS system on its own may not be an unethical system, the way it was implemented can certainly deemed unethical. Firstly the facts of the situation must be analyze and what stakeholder groups are affected by them. 
Boeing decided to use the same 50-year old airframe but place modern efficient engines. This affects the Boeing engineers along with airlines and passengers. The engineers are tasked with placing a bigger engine that does not fit the same way the old engines did, introducing a design challenge [1]. The airlines and passengers should benefit from lower operational costs. 

Boeing decided to use their military application MCAS system on this plane to address poor flight dynamics [2]. The stakeholders of this decision are primarily the pilots as this system directly affects their control over the plane. 

Boeing promised airlines no additional training is necessary for the crew when switching to the Max version [3]. Again the stakeholder group primarily affected by this are pilots, who have a different control system acting. 
Lastly to fulfill their promise, Boeing purposely hid mentions of MCAS from pilot handbooks. Moreover, to avoid regulatory overhead, the MCAS system was presented to the FAA in a dishonest and fragmented way [4].
