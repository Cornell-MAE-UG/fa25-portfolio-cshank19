Background
The 737Max aircraft was introduced to the public by Boeing in August 2011. Although widely successfully and operated worldwide the original 737 airframe was start to be dated and held back due to the it age; it has been running since the 1960s. In December of 2010, Airbus announced the A320neo, a modern update to one its most popular airframes as well. This announcement was met with praise and business grew for Airbus. As Boeing’s biggest competitor, this success drove Boeing to abandon plans for a completely new line of aircraft and instead pursue at refresh of the 737 family [1]. This resulted in the introduction of the 737Max just a few month after the A320neo was introduced with similar engines and other improvements, which quickly became one of Boeing fastest-selling airliner [1].
